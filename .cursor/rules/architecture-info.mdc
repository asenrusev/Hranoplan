# Hranoplan Architecture

## Core Technologies
- Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript
- React 19
- Supabase (Database & Auth)
- Tailwind CSS
- PWA Support

## Architecture Patterns
1. **API-First Design**
   - All database operations must go through Next.js API routes
   - API routes are located in `/app/api/*`
   - Direct database access from client components is prohibited

2. **Data Flow**
   - Client → API Route → Supabase → Database
   - Type-safe database operations using Supabase client
   - Environment variables for configuration

3. **Database Schema**
   - Main tables: recipes, meal_plans, meal_plan_recipes
   - Type definitions in `/utils/supabase.ts`
   - Database migrations handled through Supabase

4. **Application Structure**
   - `/app` - Next.js app router pages and API routes
   - `/utils` - Shared utilities and database client
   - `/scripts` - Database setup and maintenance
   - `/public` - Static assets

5. **Security**
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - API route validation
   - Supabase RLS policies
   - Anonymous user support

6. **Performance**
   - Server components by default
   - Client components only when necessary
   - PWA for offline support
   - Vercel Analytics integration

This project uses NextJS with an API and Supabase as database. Whenever new implementation is needed, everything should go through the API before reaching the Database. It's a meal prep simple app.
